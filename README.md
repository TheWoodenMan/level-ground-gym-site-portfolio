# Level Ground Gym

This site was built from scratch using floats and a design/figma as a reference.

## How It's Made:
<br/>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, 

As a fairly basic site, this one makes heavy use of photos as background-image, full vh sections and a quite detailed footer.

## Optimizations
<br/>
I considered going back and doing it again with flexbox, it worked out quite well with floats due to the simplicity of the site.

## Lessons Learned:
<br/>
This site showed me the importance of choosing the stock images carefully, the first draft had a number of images which were funny but kind of
detracted from the site's overall theme and tone. I changed these with stock images from unsplash which fit the serious, keep fit look more appropriately.

The icons were low res too and had to be swapped out - again, a website is only as good as the quality of it's copy, content and images.

Future sites I built had these ideals baked in from the start.
